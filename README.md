# Programming solutions "Spatiotemporal Modelling and Simulation" (summer 2020)

This repository contains my personal solutions to the programming exercises of [Spatiotemporal Modelling and Simulation](http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=education/courses/STMS) at TU Dresden of summer 2020. Be aware of possible mistakes in the code; I do not claim perfect correctness.

## Required dependencies
- python 3
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to run
1. clone the repository
2. navigate the current path into one of the "sheet" folders _(important for finding libraries)_
3. execute any of the .py files in the current "sheet" folder
4. there are exercises with multiple main methods to choose from _(enum at top of file)_
